### Random Acts of Pizza

This dataset contains 5671 textual requests for pizza from the Reddit community Random Acts of Pizza together with their outcome (successful/unsuccessful) and meta-data. We use multiple machine learning approaches to build models that predict if a request will be successful or not. Some of our methods rely on the paper How to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests (Althoff et al., 2014).
